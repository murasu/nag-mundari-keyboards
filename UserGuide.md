# Nag Mundari Keyboards - User Guide

The Nag Mundari script was only encoded in the Unicode standard in 2022. As such, operating systems and applications do not yet support this script. There will be issues, especially in applications that uses script information.

However, we can create text using simple text editing. As newer versions of operating systems and applications include support, the same font and keyboard should work across them.

## Installing the font

1. Get the fonts from the NotoSans Nag Mundari Project: https://notofonts.github.io/nag-mundari/. 
2. Download the regular and bold TTF files.
3. Windows: Right click on the font files and select 'Install'. In macOS, open the files in Font Book and click install.

## Installing the keyboard

### A. Windows

1. Download the zip file with the installer from here: https://github.com/murasu/nag-mundari-keyboards/blob/main/Windows/nmundari.zip.
2. Unzip the file and double click Setup.exe to install the keyboards.
3. If needed, restart your computer.
4. The Nag Mundari keyboard will show as Oriya US (NagMundari) keyboard. Select that and start typing.
5. Note that you can't type Nag Mundari in all applications. This one works: https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Software/BabelPad.html.

### B. macOS

1. Download and copy the NagMundari.keylayout file to ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts directory or /Library/Keyboard Layouts directory if it's for all users.
2. Logout and login again.
3. Add the new keyboard via System Preferences/Keyboard/Input Sources. Nag Mundari will not be in the language list. Look for it in "Others".
4. You can type Nag Mundari in TextEdit. It does not work in Pages or Keynote (yet, I hope).
